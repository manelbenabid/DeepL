All layers of the neural network collapse into one — with linear activation functions, no matter how many layers in the neural network, the last layer will be a linear function of the first layer (because a linear combination of linear functions is still a linear function).

Clearly, the sum of the probabilities of an email being either spam or not spam is 1.0.  Softmax extends this idea into a multi-class world. That is, Softmax assigns decimal probabilities to each class in a multi-class problem. Those decimal probabilities must add up to 1.0.

Recall, the ReLU activation function gives the derivate as 1 when the value is positive. In case when the value is negative, the derivative becomes 0 during backpropagation.  This means that when the value is negative, no learning happens since during the backpropagation stage, zero values' gradient descents become zero again and they do not converge to good local minimum. It is a dead end situation. Leaky ReLU substitutes zero values with some small value say 0.001 (referred as “alpha”). So, for leaky ReLU, the function is:\n",

In terms of batch size, the performance of both activation functions decrease as batch size increases, potentially due to sharp minima (Keskar et al., 2017).
