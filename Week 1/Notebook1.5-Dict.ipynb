    "\n",
    "* Finding elements in a set vs a list:  `x in C` is valid whether the collection `C` is a list, set or dictonary. However computationally for large collections this is much slower with lists than sets or dictionaries. On the other hand if all items are indexed by an integer than `x[45672]` is much faster to look up if x is a list than if it is a dictionary.\n",
    "* If all your items are indexed by integers but with some indices unused you could use lists and assign some dummy value (e.g. \"\") whenever there is no corresponding item. For very sparse collections this could consume significant additional memory compared to a dictionary. On the other hand if most values are present, then storing the indices explicitly (as is done in a dictionary) could consume significant additional memory compared to the list representation.\n"
